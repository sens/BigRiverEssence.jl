Container for a fitted kernel PLS regression model, as returned by `plskern`.
Holds the standard PLS factor matrices and the centering/scaling statistics

- `P::Matrix{T}`: The p×nlv X-loadings
- `Q::Matrix{T}`: The q×nlv Y-loadings
- `R::Matrix{T}`: The p×nlv weight matrix in the deflated basis, so that scores

	plskern(X::Matrix{Float64}, Y::Matrix{Float64}; nlv::Int = 2,

Fit a kernel partial least squares (PLS) regression using the improved algorithms
of Dayal & MacGregor (1997). The caller's `X` and `Y` are left untouched; centering
and scaling are done on internal copies
# Arguments
- `X::Matrix{Float64}`: 2d array of floats; the n×p predictor matrix
- `Y::Matrix{Float64}`: 2d array of floats; the n×q response matrix
- `nlv::Int`: The number of latent variables; clamped to min(nlv, n, p). Defaults to 2
- `standardize::Bool`: Whether to scale each column to unit standard deviation in
  addition to centering. Defaults to false (center only)
- `method::Symbol`: `:algo1` (kernel via XᵀY) or `:algo2` (kernel via XᵀX,
  faster when p ≪ n). Both give identical results. Defaults to `:algo1`
# Value
A `plskernStructure` holding the weight (W, R), loading (P, Q), and score (T)
matrices together with the centering means and scales
