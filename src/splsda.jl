2d array of floats; the column-centered (and, if scale=true, unit-variance)
matrix. Constant columns (zero standard deviation) are guarded: their scale is
treated as 1 and the column is set to all zeros rather than producing NaN. The
n−1 (corrected) standard deviation matches mixOmics' colSds

One-hot encode a vector of class labels into a dummy indicator matrix

	_soft_threshold_L1!(out, x, nx::Int, absx, ord, ranks)

Soft-threshold a loading vector to keep only its largest-magnitude entries,
writing the result into a preallocated buffer
# Arguments
- `out`: 1d array of floats; the destination buffer, overwritten in place
- `x`: 1d array of floats; the loading vector to threshold
- `nx::Int`: The number of SMALLEST-magnitude entries to drop (= p − keepX). If
  nx ≤ 0 the vector is copied through unchanged
- `absx`: 1d array of floats; preallocated scratch for the entry magnitudes
- `ord`: 1d array of ints; preallocated scratch for the sort permutation
- `ranks`: 1d array of ints; preallocated scratch for the magnitude ranks
# Value
The buffer `out`, holding the thresholded vector: the `keepX = p − nx` largest
entries survive (shrunk by λ = the largest dropped magnitude), the rest are
zeroed. Implements the L1 penalty P_λ(u) = sign(u)(|u| − λ)₊ of Lê Cao et al.
(2011), reparameterized as a keep-count rather than a λ (mixOmics
`soft_thresholding_L1`). The rank computation handles magnitude ties so that

  length ncomp (one sparsity budget per component)

- `tol::Real`: The convergence tolerance on the loading iterates. Defaults to 1e-6
- `max_iter::Int`: The maximum number of inner iterations per component.

# Value
An `splsdaStructure` holding the X and Y variates (scores), the sparse X and
dense Y loadings, the number of components, the per-component keepX, the one-hot

indicator matrix and the problem solved as a sparse PLS regression of X onto that
matrix: each component is the penalized rank-1 approximation of the cross-product
