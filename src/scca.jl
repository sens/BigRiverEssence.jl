An `SccaStructure` holding the sparse X and Y canonical vectors (u, v), the

whose projected variates are maximally correlated under an L1 penalty (so each
vector selects only a few variables). It uses the diagonal-covariance penalized
formulation of Witten, Tibshirani & Hastie (2009): each component is a rank-1
penalized approximation of XᵀY solved by alternating soft-thresholded power
iteration, after which the data are deflated before the next component
