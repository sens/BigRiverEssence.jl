A `ccaStructure` with the top-p canonical directions and correlations. Works from
the SVDs of Zx and Zy directly rather than forming covariance matrices, which is
the numerically stable route advocated by Weenink (2003): the canonical
correlations are the singular values of the overlap between the two
right-singular-vector bases, and the canonical directions are recovered by
rescaling the left singular vectors so the variates have unit variance

canonical correlations are the eigenvalues, one side's directions are the

	cca(X::Matrix{Float64}, Y::Matrix{Float64}; method::Symbol = :svd,

Fit a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between two sets of variables, after
Weenink (2003)
# Arguments
- `X::Matrix{Float64}`: 2d array of floats; the first variable set, with variables
  in ROWS and observations in COLUMNS (dx×n)
- `Y::Matrix{Float64}`: 2d array of floats; the second variable set (dy×n), with
  the same number of observations (columns) as X
- `method::Symbol`: The solver, `:svd` (works directly from the centered data,
  more stable) or `:cov` (works from covariance matrices). Both give the same
  result. Defaults to `:svd`
- `outdim::Int`: The number of canonical components to return; must be in
  1:min(dx, dy). Defaults to min(dx, dy)
# Value
A `ccaStructure` holding the X and Y means, the canonical directions for each
side, and the canonical correlations (descending). CCA finds pairs of directions,
one in X-space and one in Y-space, whose projected variates are maximally
correlated; the k-th pair is the most correlated subject to being uncorrelated
with the previous k−1. The default solver follows the SVD-based approach of
Weenink (2003), which avoids forming covariance matrices for numerical stability.
