# Test/cca_test.jl — tests for cca (canonical correlation analysis, after Weenink
# 2003), cca_transform, and the internal solvers (_cca_svd_opt, _cca_cov_opt,
# _qnormalize!). Tolerances (tol_ord / tol_julia / tol_r) come from runtests.jl.
#
# ORIENTATION: cca takes variables in ROWS, observations in COLUMNS (X is dx×n) —
# the OPPOSITE of pca/spc. So means are over dims=2, and the canonical variates
# come out as (components × observations). Watch this throughout.
#
# Reference is MultivariateStats.CCA (pure Julia — no fixtures, no R). CCA is a
# deterministic eigenproblem, so results agree bit-identically up to per-column
# sign: the MVS check uses the tight tol_ord, with projections compared
# sign-invariantly (column-wise |·|) and correlations directly (they're sign-free).
